    <h2>Let me introduce myself</h2>
    <h3>
        Personality:
    </h3>
    <p>I'm a developer living in Melbourne, Australia. I love video games, Netflix,
        cats, and
        baking. Lately, I've gotten into bike riding -
        there are some amazing paths around Melbourne!</p>
    <p>
        I'm originally from a small farmer town in New Zealand called Bombay. One of the best parts of growing up
        there
        Next door growing up was a paddock of
        soft friendly cows - they inspired a love of nature and being outdoors.

    </p>

    <p>
        Being in a small country town meant there wasn't much to do during the day at times. That's how I got into
        video gaming.

    </p>

    <p>
        My passion for video games eventually lead me to move to Auckland to study software engineering at Media
        Design School. Originally, I tried it because I felt more confident in my math abilities than in art. But I
        grew to appreciate that programming itself is an artform - one that I love and am good at!
    </p>

    <p>
        Following my successes in Media Design School, I quickly landed a job in game development. Now, having
        been there for 6 years, I've worked on many cool projects, and even worked my way up to
        management.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now I'm seeking something to to learn. I have my sights set on professional web development.
