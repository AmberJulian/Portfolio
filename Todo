How to mobile phone:
1. Fix the Header screen. 
Picture should go on top of the text.
Text should be smaller.
Arrow is fine.


2. Projects window:
The padding on the one side is nice, 
although the width of the entire thing needs to be bigger
On mobile, they need to be equal widths

 - Need to one line the heading
Need to make sure that the headings border also extends around the tech stack area
